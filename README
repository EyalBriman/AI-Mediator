In this study, we propose deliberative coalition formation approach within a metric space, incorporating the use of AI-mediators. Our framework involves $n$ agents, each expressing their preferences, with the objective of reaching a majority-supported proposal. Referred to as AI-mediators, our algorithm aims to facilitate this process. Building upon previous research, we provide a formal model that encompasses various coalition formation strategies. To illustrate the practical application of our model, we present a specific use case involving agents' preferred texts. The challenge is to identify a text-based proposal that can secure majority approval. We address this problem through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) perspective, leveraging embedding techniques into a Euclidean space. Furthermore, we introduce several mediator algorithms designed to address this problem. Through simulations, we compare the performance of these algorithms, shedding light on their strengths and weaknesses. Our study not only evaluates algorithmic efficiency but also explores structural patterns within instances that prove more effective for different mediator algorithms.
