We consider a setting in which agents report their ideal points in some metric space and the task is to find a point that is preferred by an agent majority over the status quo. To model AI-assisted deliberation process in this context, we utilize a solution based on an AI-mediator: at each iteration, the AI-mediator picks an agent subset and propose them to joint an agent coalition centered around some point. We develop several realizations of such an AI-mediator and evaluate on two settings: first, we consider a 2-Dimensional Euclidean space; and, second, we consider a metric space over textual documents. In the latter setting, we leverage NLP embeddings and LLMs to represent and work with agent coalitions centered around textual documents. Through simulations and comparative analyses of our algorithms, we evaluate their quality; additionally, we explore structural properties that affect such quality.
The text.py is the text coalition formation use case script, the location.py is the euclidean coalition formation use case script. Notcie that for the text use case one has to get an OpenAI API key.
