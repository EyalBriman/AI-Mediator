In this study, we introduce a deliberative coalition formation approach situated in a metric space and featuring AI-mediators. Our framework involves a group of $n$ agents, each expressing their individual preferences, all working towards the common objective of reaching a majority-supported proposal. Our AI-mediated algorithm is designed to facilitate this process. Building upon prior research, we present a comprehensive formal model that encompasses a range of diverse coalition formation strategies. To illustrate the practical application of our model, we present two specific scenarios. Firstly, we focus on the identification of agents' preferred locations for a social event, which are represented as coordinates in an $2$-dimensional Euclidean plane. Within this context, we conduct a simulation employing an analytical approach. This simulation aims to propose a potential social event location while outlining the approval process that each agent undergoes within the coalition for a given proposal.
Secondly, we explore another use case centered around determining agents' preferred text. Addressing this challenge through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, we utilize embedding techniques that map textual data into a Euclidean space, enabling quantitative analysis. Through simulations and evaluations, we perform a comparative analysis of various algorithms employed in these scenarios. This analysis sheds light on their respective strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to assess algorithmic efficiency. Additionally, our study delves into exploring structural patterns within instances that exhibit higher efficacy for different mediator algorithms, providing deeper insights into their functionality and applicability.
